# E-Studio Rebuild Blueprint

This document is the implementation blueprint for turning the current E-Studio application into a coherent, production-grade, maintainable, and scalable product.

It is based on a full engineering review of the current codebase and focuses on a rebuild that preserves the product’s strongest ideas while removing architectural, workflow, data, and UX problems that would become costly in a real production environment.

---

## 1. Rebuild objective

The current codebase demonstrates a strong product vision: a retail label design and print-production studio with template authoring, import mapping, pricing logic, mobile intake, export tooling, and catalog workflows.

The main issue is not lack of ambition; it is lack of coherent product architecture and clear responsibility boundaries. The rebuild should transform this from a feature-rich prototype into a durable application with:

- a clean modular architecture
- explicit domain boundaries
- predictable state management
- real production workflows
- maintainable front-end and service layers
- a secure and reliable backend for sync and integration
- a strong accessibility and UX foundation
- testability from day one

---

## 2. Design principles

The rebuild will follow these principles:

1. Product-first architecture
   - each module solves one job
   - no module owns unrelated state or unauthorized side effects

2. Clear domain separation
   - UI code handles rendering and events
   - domain services handle rules, calculations, validation, and orchestration
   - repositories handle persistence
   - integrations handle external APIs and sync

3. Local-first but production-safe
   - local data is fast and resilient
   - external sync is explicit, authenticated, and recoverable

4. Accessibility by default
   - keyboard support, focus management, screen reader semantics, contrast, and reduced motion are mandatory

5. Reliability over cleverness
   - prefer explicit flows over hidden side effects
   - every operation should have a recoverable state

6. Test the real behavior
   - UI tests for user workflows
   - domain tests for pricing, imposition, and data mapping
   - integration tests for sync and export flows

---

## 3. Recommended target architecture

### 3.1 Architectural direction

Use a layered architecture with explicit module ownership.

- Presentation layer
  - React screens and components
  - route-driven layouts
  - design-system primitives

- Application layer
  - feature orchestration
  - workflow state
  - navigation and task setup

- Domain layer
  - template editing logic
  - pricing engine
  - imposition engine
  - validation
  - export orchestration
  - rules evaluation

- Data layer
  - repositories for templates, catalog, jobs, preferences
  - IndexedDB/local-first persistence
  - sync queue and reconciliation logic

- Integration layer
  - API adapters
  - mobile pairing
  - print/export services
  - remote sync and catalog integrations

- Backend layer
  - authenticated services
  - durable job records
  - device registry
  - catalog and sync storage

### 3.2 State model

The application must use a strict split between:

- UI state
  - panel open/closed
  - selected tool
  - transient toast messages
  - hover states

- Domain state
  - template structure
  - product records
  - job lifecycle
  - sync status
  - validation results

- Server state
  - remote catalogs
  - device registry
  - sync jobs
  - print/export metadata

This split prevents “everything is local state” problems that currently create fragile cross-feature coupling.

## 5. Module definitions and responsibilities

### 5.1 App shell

Responsibilities:
- global layout and navigation
- route selection and shell composition
- modal host
- global notifications
- authentication/session handling if needed

Key modules:
- AppShell
- TopNav
- SideNav
- WorkspaceHeader
- GlobalModalHost

### 5.2 Dashboard module

Responsibilities:
- open workspaces
- recent templates
- quick actions
- search and filters
- start new template flow

Primary user goals:
- choose a template or start a new one
- see overall workspace status
- access high-level actions

### 5.3 Template editor module

Responsibilities:
- canvas editing
- selection and transform logic
- smart guides and snapping
- object property editing
- history and undo/redo
- save and validation flow

This module should not own catalog, print queue, or mobile sync responsibilities.

### 5.4 Generation / print preparation module

Responsibilities:
- data import and review
- mapping and normalization
- preview generation
- imposition planning
- export generation
- print queue state

This is the successor to the current generation workspace and should become a domain-oriented production workflow.

### 5.5 Catalog module

Responsibilities:
- product database management
- lookup/search/filtering
- import processing
- dedupe and merge options
- manual edits and review

This module should operate on canonical product data and expose domain-level functions rather than raw UI-only mutations.

### 5.6 Mobile sync module

Responsibilities:
- handshake and pairing
- lot ingestion
- device sessions
- batch review
- acceptance/rejection workflow
- sync status and recovery

The mobile sync module should not directly manipulate the entire app state; it should emit actions and sync queue events.

### 5.7 Rules engine module

Responsibilities:
- condition evaluation
- action execution
- contextual routing and display rules
- conflict resolution
- audit logs

This should be designed as a deterministic rules engine with formal evaluation output.

### 5.8 Export and print orchestration module

Responsibilities:
- PDF generation
- ZPL generation
- PowerPoint export
- job queue management
- print validation and warnings

This should be treated as a dedicated service domain, not as inline UI code.

---

## 6. Interface contracts

The project needs explicit contracts so that UI, domain logic, storage, and APIs share a single truth model.

### 6.1 Template model

```ts
export type TemplateStatus = 'draft' | 'valid' | 'warning' | 'error';

}

export interface TemplateItem extends TemplateItemBase {
  [key: string]: unknown;
}
```

### 6.3 Product record model

```ts

  UNIT?: string;
  CURRENCY?: string;
  raw?: Record<string, unknown>;
  updatedAt?: string;
}
```

### 6.4 Catalog import result

```ts
export interface ImportResult {
  sourceName: string;
  rowCount: number;
  validRows: number;
  invalidRows: number;
  mappedProducts: ProductRecord[];
  warnings: ImportWarning[];
  errors: ImportError[];
}

export interface ImportWarning {
  code: string;
  message: string;
  rowIndex?: number;
}

export interface ImportError {
  code: string;
  message: string;
  rowIndex?: number;
}
```

### 6.5 Sync session and job model

```ts
export type SyncJobStatus = 'queued' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'needs_review';

export interface SyncJob {
  id: string;
  type: 'product_import' | 'template_sync' | 'mobile_lot' | 'catalog_pull';
  status: SyncJobStatus;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  sourceDeviceId?: string;
  destinationDeviceId?: string;
  payload?: Record<string, unknown>;
  error?: string;
}

export interface SyncSession {
  id: string;
  deviceId: string;
  deviceName: string;
  startedAt: string;
  lastSeenAt: string;
  status: 'connected' | 'offline' | 'paired' | 'error';
  token?: string;
}
```

### 6.6 Export job model

```ts
export type ExportFormat = 'pdf' | 'pptx' | 'zpl' | 'json';

export interface ExportJob {
  id: string;
  templateId: string;
  format: ExportFormat;
  status: 'queued' | 'generating' | 'ready' | 'failed';
  fileName: string;
  createdAt: string;
  completedAt?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

## 7. Application workflow architecture

The rebuild should define the user journey as a workflow engine, not a loose collection of screens.

### 7.1 Core workflow states

1. Template selection
2. Template validation
3. Product import
4. Mapping confirmation
5. Print preview
6. Export / print submission
7. Sync and handoff

### 7.2 Standard screen state model

Every major screen should support:

- loading
- idle empty
- data available
- validation warnings
- partial errors
- transient offline mode
- permission or access denied
- recovery / retry state
- success state

This pattern reduces hidden assumptions and creates predictable UX.

## 10. Migration strategy from the current implementation

The rebuild should not be a full stop-the-world rewrite. It should be phased and incremental.

### Phase A — Freeze and inventory
- identify stable features worth preserving
- document variants and hidden dependencies
- decide which parts are truly strategic vs disposable

### Phase B — Introduce foundations without breaking the app
- add design system foundation
- introduce repository abstractions
- create typed domain contracts
- migrate one feature at a time

### Phase C — Migrate feature modules
- dashboard first
- then template editor
- then generation and print workflows
- then catalog and sync

### Phase D — Remove legacy dependencies
- delete legacy “everything in one state” patterns
- remove ad hoc side effects from UI modules
- replace localStorage-heavy logic with repository interfaces

### Phase E — Harden and launch
- production readiness checks
- monitoring and validation
- final release gating

---

## 11. Recommended implementation order

1. Contracts and domain schemas
2. Design system and shell
3. Local storage and repository layer
4. Template editor domain
5. Catalog import and mapping
6. Print generation and export services
7. Sync and mobile modules
8. Rules engine
9. Security and observability
10. Release hardening

This order keeps system architecture stable before more complex workflows are rebuilt.

---

## 12. Validation criteria by phase

### Phase validation checklist

- no leaky state across unrelated features
- no feature directly mutates unrelated modules
- all critical flows are testable and observable
- all screens have clear empty/loading/error states
- key actions are accessible with keyboard navigation
- data persistence survives refresh/restart
- sync flows work offline and recover on reconnect
- export jobs produce consistent output for realistic cases

---

## 13. Final outcome

The final product should be:

- coherent: one clear product architecture, not a bag of adjacent features
- maintainable: modules have clearly defined responsibilities
- user-friendly: workflows are guided, efficient, and understandable
- scalable: local data and sync systems can grow without architectural breakage
- production-ready: security, monitoring, reliability, and validation are built in

This rebuild is not about removing the product’s ambition; it is about making the ambition sustainable.

---

## 14. Recommended immediate next steps

1. Freeze the product contract in a single source of truth.
2. Define the core domain models for templates, products, jobs, and sync.
3. Build the design system foundation before migrating feature logic.
4. Move storage and data access behind repository contracts.
5. Rebuild the editor in a modular structure.
6. Move print and export into service domains.
7. Rebuild catalog and sync flows using explicit job and sync states.
8. Add automated tests and release readiness checks before launch.

This is the lowest-risk path to converting the current product into a durable, coherent digital production platform.
